#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about people and their hobbies. 

#1. Insert one more row in persons and then one more row in hobbies that is related to the newly inserted person.
INSERT INTO persons (name,age) VALUES ("Echo", 2);
INSERT INTO hobbies (person_id, name) VALUES (5, "barking");

#2. Display a table showing people's names with their hobbies.
SELECT p.name, h.name
FROM persons AS p
JOIN hobbies AS h
ON p.id = h.person_id;

#3. Add an additional query that shows only the name and hobbies of 'Bobby McBobbyFace'.
SELECT p.name, h.name
FROM persons AS p
JOIN hobbies AS h
ON p.id = h.person_id
WHERE p.name = "Bobby McBobbyFace";

#4. Show the names of each pair of friends, based on the data in the friends table.
SELECT a.name, b.name
FROM friends
JOIN persons AS a
ON a.id = friends.person1_id
JOIN persons AS b
ON b.id = friends.person2_id;
