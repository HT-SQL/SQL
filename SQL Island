--After the survived plane crash, you will be stuck on SQL Island for the time being. 
--By making progress in the game, you will find a way to escape from this island.
--Oh dear, what happened? It seems that I am the only survivor of the air crash. Wow, there are some villages on this island.
--It seems there are a few people living in these villages. How can I see a list of all inhabitants?

SELECT * FROM inhabitant;

--Okay, let's see who is friendly on this island...

SELECT * FROM inhabitant 
WHERE state = 'friendly';

--There is no way around getting a sword for myself. I will now try to find a friendly weaponsmith to forge me one.

WHERE state = 'friendly'

--Oh, that does not look good. Maybe other friendly smiths can help you out, e.g. a blacksmith
SELECT * FROM inhabitant

--Hi stranger! Where are you going? I'm Paul, I'm the major of Monkeycity. I will go ahead and register you as a citizen.
--No need to call me stranger! What's my personid?

--Hi Ernest! How much is a sword?

--Find a friendly inhabitant who is either a dealer or a merchant. Maybe they want to buy some of my items.

--Unfortunately, that's not enough gold to buy a sword. Seems like I do have to work after all.

--Since baking is one of my hobbies, why not find a baker who I can work for?

--How much gold is that?

--For some reason, butchers own the most gold. How much gold do different inhabitants have on average, depending on their state (friendly, ...)?
