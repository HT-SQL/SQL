#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with two tables in it to quantify statistics about people and their hobbies. 

#1. Insert one more row in persons and then one more row in hobbies that is related to the newly inserted person.
INSERT INTO persons (name,age) VALUES ("Echo", 2);
INSERT INTO hobbies (person_id, name) VALUES (5, "barking");

#2. Select the 2 tables with a join so that you can see each person's name next to their hobby.
SELECT p.name, h.name
FROM persons AS p
JOIN hobbies AS h
ON p.id = h.person_id;

#3. Add an additional query that shows only the name and hobbies of 'Bobby McBobbyFace'.
SELECT p.name, h.name
FROM persons AS p
JOIN hobbies AS h
ON p.id = h.person_id
WHERE p.name = "Bobby McBobbyFace";
