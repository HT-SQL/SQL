#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with one table in it to quantify statistics about books. 

#1. Select all the authors that have written more than 1 million words. Your results table should include the 'author' and 
their total word count as a 'total_words' column.
SELECT author, SUM(words) AS total_words 
FROM books 
GROUP BY author 
HAVING total_words > 1000000;

#2. Select all the authors that write more than an average of 150,000 words per book. Your results table should include 
the 'author' and average words as an 'avg_words' column.
SELECT author, AVG(words) AS avg_words 
FROM books 
GROUP BY author 
HAVING avg_words > 150000;
