#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with one table in it to quantify statistics about student grades. 

#1. Select all of the rows, and display the name, number_grade, and percent_completed, which you can compute by 
multiplying and rounding the fraction_completed column.
SELECT name, number_grade, 
ROUND(fraction_completed * 100) AS percent_completed 
FROM student_grades;

#2. How many students have earned which letter_grade? The number_grade column should output 'A' for grades > 90, 
'B' for grades > 80, 'C' for grades > 70, and 'F' otherwise. 
SELECT COUNT(*),
CASE
    WHEN number_grade > 90 THEN "A"
    WHEN number_grade > 80 THEN "B"
    WHEN number_grade > 70 THEN "C"
    ELSE "F"
END AS letter_grade
FROM student_grades
GROUP BY letter_grade;
