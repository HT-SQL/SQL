#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with two tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. List the name and email of every customer followed by the item and price of orders they've made.
SELECT c.name, c.email, o.item, o.price
FROM customers AS c
LEFT OUTER JOIN orders AS o
ON c.id = o.customer_id;

#2. Create another query that will result in one row per each customer, with their name, email, and total amount of money
they've spent on orders. Sort the rows according to the total money spent, from the most spent to the least spent.
SELECT c.name, c.email, SUM(o.price) AS spent
FROM customers AS c
LEFT OUTER JOIN orders AS o
ON c.id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.name
ORDER BY spent DESC;
